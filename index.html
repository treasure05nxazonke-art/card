      <main>
        <p id="first">Happy Birthday, Mummy! I really miss you, and I love you so much. You have been so patient with us, always playing 
            the roles of both father and mother, guiding us with love and strength. You work tirelessly for our well-being, 
            and sometimes we fail to notice or appreciate all that you do—but please know, Mama, we are truly grateful for 
            never giving up on us.</p>

        <p id="second">We love and respect you deeply. I am sorry for the times we bring you heartbreak. 
            Sometimes we long for your presence, emotionally and mentally, 
            but we distance ourselves because we don't want to stress you. That doesn't mean we love you any 
            less—our hearts are always with you, thinking of you every single moment.</p>

        <p id="third">Sometimes, I like calling my siblings “Emily's daughter” or “Emily's son” to remind myself 
            that you are our mom and that you always think of us. Words cannot express how much I miss you. 
            There are times when I feel tired, lonely, or just overwhelmed, and I long for the comfort of my 
            mother's embrace. I miss the warmth of your love, the comfort of your words, and the peace that only you can give.</p>

        <p id="fourth">It hurts so much to miss you, Mummy. I wish you could be here with me, yet I know that all you do is for our future, 
            and I trust that your sacrifices are shaping our lives in the best way possible. I cling to the hope that God, who hears 
            our hearts and loves us unconditionally, will make a way for us to be together. We just need to be patient with Him.</p>

        <p id="sixth">Mama, you are my heart, my guide, and my safe place. Even when we fall short or make mistakes, 
            your love never wavers, teaching us the meaning of resilience, kindness, and unconditional love. I pray every 
            day for your health, happiness, and peace, and I want you to always know that your children love you beyond words, 
            beyond distance, and beyond time.</p>
